# Temple Quest (Name will probably change)

A stylized game set in the midst of a temple. Defeat the temple bosses to reach the final boss, blahblahblah more lore here.

**FOR KEAGEN AND EINON**
- Whenever you create a new class, make it in its own .h file and have its own .cpp file (yes there will be a lot of .h files at the end of this project but it will make shit so much easier for us)
- We gotta comment our code, that way we know what we were all trying to do 
- Mess with SFML before editing this project (prevent confusion)
- Great programming patterns: https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html
- Only program in the development branch, you can use "**git checkout development**" to switch to the development branch
- Don't merge to the master till we can all agree on it

**SET UP**
Go to the development branch
