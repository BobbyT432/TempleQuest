- Whenever you create a new class, make it in its own .h file and have its own .cpp file (yes there will be a lot of .h files at the end of this project but it will make stuff so much easier for us)
- We gotta comment our code, that way we know what we were all trying to do 
- Mess with SFML before editing this project (prevent confusion)
- Great programming patterns: https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html
- Only program in the development branch, you can use "**git checkout development**" to switch to the development branch
- Don't merge to the master till we can all agree on it

**SET UP**
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
- Download the entire repo
- Install SFML into the project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfMQyOw1zik
- Done

**NOTE**
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Whenever you push files, try not to push ANY of the **.dll** files that SFML gives you, install SFML manually on each of our machines that way we can just keep the files here and the solution file.
