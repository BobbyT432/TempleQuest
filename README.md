# The Legend of The Crimson King

A stylized game based on an island in the midst of terror.

Built in two weeks for our C/C++ Data Structures class, using SFML, (team of three).


# NOTE
- Code is not yet merged to the master branch, to view the code switch to the **development** branch
- The code is pretty sloppy in some areas (my first full game i've ever made)
