# The Legend of The Crimson King

A stylized game based on an island in the midst of terror.

Built in two weeks for our end of the year project in a C/C++ Data Structures class, using SFML, (team of three).

Thanks to Keagen for making the trailer!

# BUILD
Currently, there is no build for this yet. To run the game you'll need to install SFML and merge the code here.

# NOTE
- Collisions are not **enabled** in the game, they were scrapped last minute in the main island
- Sounds were also scrapped last minute due to an error
- The game will close if you die / win
- The code is pretty sloppy in some areas (my first full game i've ever made)
